    <p class = "text">Agata Klu&zacute;niak was born in Warsaw in 1979. After completing secondary education she moved to Pozna&nacute; to study at the Fine Arts Academy renown for its printmaking department. She studied there in the years 1999-2006, eventually obtaining an MA in the Fine Arts. During that time she concentrated mostly on learning etching, lithography, drawing and painting. After years of life-drawing she recognised her key to understanding abstract images and became very drawn to ways of creating based on the process. This was like an opening of a new world, one of an organic order, with fluid boundaries. Agata sees art practice as a process of constant learning and opening of the mind. For her, this process started in Pozna&nacute;.
	Close to the end of her studies she started a family and moved with her partner to Ireland shortly after.
	In 2011 she became a member of the Cork Printmakers, a printmaking cooperative based in Cork city.
	She now is a mother of three beautiful daughters and continues to live and create on the West coast of Ireland.<br><br>
